# Advance_AI_Final_Lab

Project for AI Lab about the multilabel classification of ECG signal

In this project, we using the CPSC2018 dataset[http://2018.icbeb.org/Challenge.html] to  the signal into 6 classes: 

(1) atrial fibrillation,
(2) left bundle branch block,
(3) 1st degree av block,
(4) premature atrial contraction,
(5) sinus rhythm, 
(6) right bundle branch block
